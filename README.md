Utility to convert geometrize data into a grab level  
# How to use
Go to the following website (https://www.samcodes.co.uk/project/geometrize-haxe-web/) and import any image  
Make sure to **only** enable **rectangles** and **rotated rectangles**, other types are not supported yet.
Set the object limit to any number, note the complexity will be double the object limit so be careful.

Then after image generation save as json.
Open the executable and simply drag and drop the geometrize json file into the CLI.
